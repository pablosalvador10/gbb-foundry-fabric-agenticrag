      "MessageRole.AGENT: The difference between \"At time of shipment\" and \"At regular hourly upload time (in batch)\" for ETD uploads is primarily about timing and control over the upload of documents:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **At Time of Shipment**: \n",
      "   - This is the preferred setting because it provides immediate confirmation that your documents have been successfully uploaded.\n",
      "   - It also allows you to get immediate feedback on any problems with uploading your documents. If upload issues occur, you can correct the problem and complete the shipment, put the shipment in the Hold file to research the problem, or manually print and attach the documents to the shipment【4:0†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **At Regular Hourly Upload Time (in batch)**:\n",
      "   - This option gives you a warning message at the time of the hourly upload if there was a document upload failure for one or more of your shipments.\n",
      "   - If a document upload failure occurs, you must manually print the label and all trade documents for that shipment and hand them to the courier at the time of pickup. If you do not complete the shipment when you receive the warning message, you must remember to review the FedEx Electronic Trade Documents Shipped List in time to complete the process before the courier arrives【4:2†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choosing between these options depends on your operational needs and the amount of control and immediacy you require in document handling.\n",
