    "**Duration**: 60 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first lab of our LLM Evaluations Workshop! In this lab, you'll learn the fundamentals of evaluating Large Language Model outputs and understand why traditional software testing approaches don't work for LLMs.\n",

    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will:\n",
    "- Understand why LLM evaluation is critical for production systems\n",
    "- Learn core evaluation metrics (relevance, coherence, groundedness)\n",
    "- Perform your first evaluation using Azure AI Foundry SDK\n",
    "- Recognize the non-deterministic nature of LLM outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Prerequisites\n",
    "- Completed setup verification notebook\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI credentials configured\n",
    "- Understanding of basic programming concepts"

    "\n",
    "Traditional software testing relies on deterministic inputs and outputs:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Traditional function - always returns the same output\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "assert add_numbers(2, 3) == 5  # This will always pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are different - they're probabilistic and can generate different outputs for the same input!"

    "### 🎯 What You've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why LLM Evaluation Matters**\n",
    "   - LLMs are non-deterministic (same input ≠ same output)\n",
    "   - Traditional testing approaches don't work\n",
    "   - Quality directly impacts business outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Core Evaluation Metrics**\n",
    "   - **Relevance**: Does it answer the question?\n",
    "   - **Coherence**: Is it clear and logical?\n",
    "   - **Fluency**: Is the language natural?\n",
    "   - **Groundedness**: Is it supported by context?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Practical Skills**\n",
    "   - Set up Azure AI evaluation environment\n",
    "   - Create and configure evaluators\n",
    "   - Run evaluations on sample data\n",
    "   - Interpret evaluation results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Lab 2**, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "- Scale evaluations to larger datasets\n",
    "- Generate synthetic evaluation data\n",
    "- Compare multiple models systematically\n",
    "- Analyze cost vs. quality trade-offs\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Import Errors**: \n",
    "   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "   - Check that you're in the correct virtual environment\n",

    "2. **Azure Connection Issues**:\n",

    "   - Check your Azure OpenAI deployment is active\n",
    "   - Ensure you have sufficient quota\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation Failures**:\n",
    "   - This is common in workshop environments\n",
    "   - The learning objective is understanding the process\n",
    "   - Try with smaller datasets or single evaluators\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rate Limiting**:\n",
    "   - Add delays between requests\n",
    "   - Use smaller batch sizes\n",
    "   - Check your Azure OpenAI tier limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Need Help?**\n",
    "- Check the troubleshooting guide: `docs/troubleshooting.md`\n",
    "- Open an issue in the GitHub repository\n",
